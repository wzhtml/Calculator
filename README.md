# This is a Two-Calculator Program
###### These are just two simple applications.
- It is available in two languages: Visual Basic and Visual C#.
- They don't have a feature that adjusts to the size of the window. They are just simple, small programs.
- Just download them and you're ready to go.
- There are also icon files included.
- Nothing else is introduced. It is a pleasure to use!
- The default installation is on the F drive and the author doesn't know how to change it
